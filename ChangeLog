	* I was getting an error opening pages that had unicode in them. I added the locale
	  module to fix that.
	* You can now open a page on the feed item window
	* Can refresh all the feeds from within the window. There still needs to be a feedback
	  instead of freezing the frame.
	* The correct item is picked when you go to the prior page.

        * The basic features: downloading feeds, viewing items, marking feeds are done.
        * Still have problems crashing when going off the page.
